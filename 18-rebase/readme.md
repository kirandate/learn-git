In Git, `git rebase` is a command used to apply a sequence of commits from one branch onto another branch. It allows you to incorporate the changes made in one branch onto the tip of another branch, resulting in a modified commit history.

Merge: When you merge one branch into another, Git combines the changes from both branches and creates a new commit that represents the merge. This results in a merge commit that has two or more parent commits. The merge commit serves as a point of integration between the branches and preserves the commit history of both branches. Merging is typically used for incorporating long-lived branches, such as when merging feature branches into the main branch (e.g., merging a "feature" branch into "master").

Rebase: Rebase, on the other hand, involves moving or applying a sequence of commits from one branch onto another branch. It effectively transplants the commits from the source branch onto the tip of the destination branch. Unlike merging, rebase does not create a merge commit. Instead, it rewrites the commit history by altering the parent-child relationships of the commits. This results in a linear history, as if the changes in the source branch were made directly on top of the destination branch. Rebasing is often used to keep feature branches up-to-date with the latest changes from the main branch, incorporating the latest commits while maintaining a clean and linear history.

Here's a comparison of merge and rebase:

Merge:

Preserves the commit history of both branches.
Creates a merge commit to represent the integration point.
Suitable for long-lived branches and preserving branch history.
Merge commits can result in a more complex commit history.

Rebase:

Rewrites the commit history of the source branch.
Results in a linear commit history.
Does not create a merge commit.
Useful for incorporating changes from one branch onto another while maintaining a cleaner history.
Particularly helpful when working with short-lived feature branches.
